{"question":{"0":"What are the main structural features of Southeast Asia according to the Plate Tectonic Model? ","1":"'What are some notable applications of graphs in computer science? "},"answer":{"0":" According to the Plate Tectonic Model, the Tertiary hydrocarbon-bearing basins in Southeast Asia are primarily located on the intra-plate margins. These basins stretch from North Thailand through the Gulf of Malaysia to the West Natuna Sea in the west, and cover the entire continental shelf of Vietnam in the east. They are distributed adjacent to or in the junction of suture zones or main faults developed on the southern boundary of the Eurasian plate during the Tertiary period, such as the Sagaing, Three Pagodas, Mae Ping - Hau Giang, Petchabun, Ranong Marui, Red River, Ma River, Rao Nay, Tam Ky-Phuoc Son, and the 1090 East Meridian faults. Understanding the plate tectonic reconstruction of Southeast Asia is crucial for studying the role of plate movement in basin generation and hydrocarbon distribution in the region.","1":" Graphs have various applications in computer science, including knowledge representation and databases through data graphs, taxonomies, and ontologies. These applications have traditionally been designed using a top-down approach, and the theory, algorithms, and implementations from general graph-based systems can be leveraged in the development of knowledge graphs.'"},"context":{"0":"Almost all Tertiary hydrocarbon-bearing basins in SE Asia are formed and developed under the influence of this period\u2019s tectonic activities (Fig. 4.1). More than 70 of them are\nlocated on the intra-plate margins, stretching in the West from North Thailand through the Gulf of Malaysia all the way down to West Natuna Sea, and covering in the East the entire continental shelf of Vietnam. These basins are distributed adjacent to or in the junction of suture zones or main faults developed on the southern boundary of the Eurasian plate during the Tertiary period, such as the Sagaing, Three Pagodas, Mae Ping - Hau Giang, Petchabun, Ranong Marui, Red River, Ma River, Rao Nay, Tam Ky-Phuoc Son, and the 1090 East Meridian faults. Consequently, an understanding of the plate tectonic reconstruction of Southeast Asia is necessary to study of the role of plate movement in relation to basin generation and hydrocarbon distribution in the region.","1":"Graphs are a fundamental construct in discrete mathematics, and have applications in all areas of computer science. Most notable uses of graphs in knowledge representation and databases have taken the form of data graphs, taxonomies and ontologies. Traditionally, such applications have been driven by a top down design. As a knowledge graph is a directed labeled graphs, we are able to leverage theory, algorithms and implementations from more general graph-based systems in computer science. "}}
