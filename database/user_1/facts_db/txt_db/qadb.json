"},"answer":{"0":" According to the Plate Tectonic Model, the Tertiary hydrocarbon-bearing basins in Southeast Asia are primarily located on the intra-plate margins. These basins stretch from North Thailand through the Gulf of Malaysia to the West Natuna Sea in the west, and cover the entire continental shelf of Vietnam in the east. They are distributed adjacent to or in the junction of suture zones or main faults developed on the southern boundary of the Eurasian plate during the Tertiary period, such as the Sagaing, Three Pagodas, Mae Ping - Hau Giang, Petchabun, Ranong Marui, Red River, Ma River, Rao Nay, Tam Ky-Phuoc Son, and the 1090 East Meridian faults. Understanding the plate tectonic reconstruction of Southeast Asia is crucial for studying the role of plate movement in basin generation and hydrocarbon distribution in the region.","1":" Graphs have various applications in computer science, including knowledge representation and databases through data graphs, taxonomies, and ontologies. These applications have traditionally been designed using a top-down approach, and the theory, algorithms, and implementations from general graph-based systems can be leveraged in the development of knowledge graphs.","2":" Semantic networks, conceptual graphs, description logics, and rule languages are some of the different representations that evolved from the early days of knowledge graphs in AI. Additionally, probabilistic graphical models were developed to capture uncertain knowledge.","3":" Entity extraction and relation extraction are two fundamental tasks in natural language processing.","4":" Two applications of knowledge graphs that have seen a recent surge in popularity are organizing information over the internet and data integration.","5":" The use of a knowledge graph like Wikidata allows for the central storage of structured data for Wikipedia, enabling the interplay between the two platforms. This integration helps resolve discrepancies and inconsistencies in information, such as sister city relationships, by automatically inferring reciprocal connections based on the symmetric relationships defined in the knowledge graph.","6":" The vocabulary of relations in Schema.Org provides several advantages. Firstly, it allows for the creation of queries that span across multiple datasets, enabling the retrieval of information that would not have been possible otherwise. For example, one can query for the birth cities of people who died in Winterthur and display them on a map. Secondly, it facilitates the generation of structured information boxes within Wikipedia. Lastly, the structured information returned by queries can also appear in search results, which is a standard feature for leading search engines.","7":" The recent version of Wikidata contains over 80 million objects and over one billion relationships among those objects."},"context":{"0":"Almost all Tertiary hydrocarbon-bearing basins in SE Asia are formed and developed under the influence of this period\u2019s tectonic activities (Fig. 4.1). More than 70 of them are\nlocated on the intra-plate margins, stretching in the West from North Thailand through the Gulf of Malaysia all the way down to West Natuna Sea, and covering in the East the entire continental shelf of Vietnam. These basins are distributed adjacent to or in the junction of suture zones or main faults developed on the southern boundary of the Eurasian plate during the Tertiary period, such as the Sagaing, Three Pagodas, Mae Ping - Hau Giang, Petchabun, Ranong Marui, Red River, Ma River, Rao Nay, Tam Ky-Phuoc Son, and the 1090 East Meridian faults. Consequently, an understanding of the plate tectonic reconstruction of Southeast Asia is necessary to study of the role of plate movement in relation to basin generation and hydrocarbon distribution in the region.","1":"Graphs are a fundamental construct in discrete mathematics, and have applications in all areas of computer science. Most notable uses of graphs in knowledge representation and databases have taken the form of data graphs, taxonomies and ontologies. Traditionally, such applications have been driven by a top down design. As a knowledge graph is a directed labeled graphs, we are able to leverage theory, algorithms and implementations from more general graph-based systems in computer science. ","2":"Knowledge graphs, known as semantic networks, have been used as a representation for Artificial Intelligence since the early days of the field. Over the years, semantic networks were evolved into different representations such as conceptual graphs, description logics, and rule languages. To capture uncertain knowledge, probabilistic graphical models were invented.","3":"Entity extraction and relation extraction from text are two fundamental tasks in natural language processing. The extracted information from multiple portions of the text needs be correlated, and knowledge graphs provide a natural medium to accomplish such a goal. For example, from the sentence shown on the left, we can extract the entities Albert Einstein, Germany, Theoretical Physicist, and Theory of Relativity; and the relations born in, occupation and developed. Once this snippet of the knowledge graph is incorporated into a larger knowledge graph, we get additional links (shown by dotted edges) such as a Theoretical Physicist is a kind of Physicist who practices Physics, and that Theory of Relativity is a branch of Physics.","4":"Recent Applications of Knowledge Graphs\nThere are numerous applications of knowledge graphs both in research and industry. Within computer science, there are many uses of a directed graph representation, for example, data flow graphs, binary decision diagrams, state charts, etc. For our discussion here, we have chosen to focus on two concrete applications that have led to recent surge in popularity of knowledge graphs: organizing information over internet and data integration. ","5":"We will explain the use of a knowledge graph over the web by taking the concrete example of Wikidata. Wikidata acts as the central storage for the structured data for Wikipedia. To show the interplay between the two, and to motivate the use of Wikidata knowledge graph, consider the city of Winterthur in Switzerland which has a page in Wikipedia. The Wikipedia page for Winterthur lists its twin towns: two are in Switerzland, one in Czech Republic, and one in Austria. The city of Ontario in California that has a Wikipedia page titled Ontario, California, lists Winterthur as its sister city. The sister city and twin city relationships are identical as well as reciprocal. Thus, if a city A is a sister city of another city B, then B must be a sister city of A. This inference should be automatic, but because this information is stated in English in Wikipedia, it is not easy to detect this discrepancy. In contrast, in the Wikidata representation of Winterthur, there is a relationship called twinned administrative body that lists the city of Ontario. As this relationship is symmetric, the Wikidata page for the city of Ontario automatically includes Winterthur. Thus, when Wikidata knowledge graph will be fully integrated into Wikipedia, such discrepancies will naturally disappear.","6":" Wikidata includes data from several independent providers, for example, the Library of Congress that publishes data containing information about Winterthur. By using the Wikidata identifier for Winterthur, the information released by Library of Congress can be easily linked with information available from other sources. Wikidata makes it easy to establish such links by publishing the definitions of relationships used in it in Schema.Org.\n\nThe vocabulary of relations in Schema.Org gives us, at least, three advantages. First, it is possible to write queries that span across multiple datasets that would not have been possible otherwise. One example of such a query is: Display on a map the birth cities of people who died in Winterthour? Second, with such a query capability, it is possible to easily generate structured information boxes within Wikipedia. Third, structured information returned by queries also can appear in the search results which is now a standard feature for the leading search engines. ","7":"A recent version of Wikidata had over 80 million objects, with over one billion relationships among those objects. Wikidata makes connections across over 4872 different catalogs in 414 different languages published by independent data providers. As per the recent estimate, 31% of the websites, and over 12 million data providers publish Schema.Org annotations are currently using the vocabulary of Schema.Org. "}}
